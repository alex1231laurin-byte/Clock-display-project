Project: clock-display
Authors: David Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class ClockDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the object inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as timeTick and setTime. Watch the 
"displayString" in the inspector.

The displayString field simulates the actual clock display device. Were this 
program running in a real clock, it would change the real, physical display 
hardware instead of this string. The timeTick method would be triggered once 
every minute by some timer hardware.

Everything else could be pretty much the same.


Note: This project does not implement adequate handling of errors.

21: It starts at 00:00 because it is its default time.
23: We would need to use the timeTick methode 60 times. The other method to make it display
that time would be to use the setTime method.
24: The definition of the variable digit is to store an integer.
